         <p>Where can I get a good brie sammy? This place.

I had been craving some brie for awhile and once again not wanting to leave my desk, I pulled up my food delivery app and came across Jax Bread Co when searching for brie. 
The Brie Melt stood out for me the most, with brie, bacon, arugula, and their housemade fruit compote on  slices of french sourdough. The menu didn't specify a side but I didn't mind that. I was happy enough with just and sandwich.</p>

Mmmmm!  Holy freakin moly!   What a wonderful place! I had a delicious sandwich!

I Went to the shopping center looking for a different sandwich place which was gone but I saw Jax Bread Co and was intrigued. 
I was happy to hear that their bread is made in house daily with unbleached and unbromated flour.  I ordered the three cheese sandwich with ham added.
 I was thankful they accommodated my alternate bread choice.</p>

         <p>I took advantage of the unseasonably mild mid-June weather and find a place to eat outside. 75*, low humidity, and breezy. 
		 In Florida. In June!? Whaaa?</p>
